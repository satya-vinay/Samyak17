						The world is open to learning, knowledge and opportunities. If this country was

one to be looked upon as a personification of digitalization that would be the

day when we can proudly proclaim that India has established the digital

revolution: Industry 4.0. which signifies the 4 th industrial revolution. It is the

stepping stone to change the structure of this country and a step towards global

digitalization.

More than just a flashy catchphrase, Industry 4.0 is an amalgam of trends and

technologies promising to reshape the way things function. Machines being

replaced by mere commands and money by a card, with the era of computers

there lies a challenging future ahead.

It first visualises the value shift by creation of a new story about how we want

to live. We have energy technologies to power our civilization solar, wind,

biomass, hydro e. t. c.… sun is shining in Germany, wind is blowing in

Denmark so we can move that electricity through an integrated grid system so

that energy can be supplied to the needy all times.

The techno-management fete SAMYAK’17 provides a platform for one and all,

to develop one’s dreams to digitize the country by adopting the theme

INDUSTRY 4.0- DREAM, DIGITIZE, DEVELOP. It opens an opportunity

for all to upgrade to meet the demands of the digitalizing country in the form of

various workshops, competitions and events in confluence with various cultural

activities projecting the cultural richness. Every workshop and competition is

aimed at taking this country ahead in terms of development. In a line, it lays the

foundation for the innovations of tomorrow.
